/*Block elements are easier to manipulate than inline elements*/
/*If you want inline, use inline-block*/
/*Relative units: */

/*For inline elements, width is ignored, heigh is ignored,
padding is ok, margin only respect horizontal*/
/*Makes block level elements to inline, very useful*/

for height and widths, you can also use "%" as to scale things
EM: relative to its parent element, eg. use this to make h3 always bigger than h1 by setting h3: 3em and h1: 1em
This is useful when you dont want your buttons or other elements to lose their shape even if the text size is scaled up

For em, if you have nested, it will increase the size multiplicatively, they can stack.
They can increase very fast and shrink very fast as well, since em is based on the parents font size.
"Rem" works better if you want relative size, its based upon the base element font size

em and rem are both good, and can be used together depending on the situations
To change overal rem, you will have to change the "html {}" font-size

rgab(0,0,0, 0 to 1) for transparency. 0 = not transparent, 1 = full transparent, does not affect text
opacity: all the elements in there will be transparent

position: static(default)
relative: changes to where it was supposed to be, it still takes up the space of where it was originally
absolute: its position is anything but static (position depending on the ancestor), determined by its parent
fixed: its position is determined by the page, it will follow even when youre scrolling
sticky: relative at first, but after you scroll down a bit, it will be like fixed

"transition" function, you can go from on shape/color to the other, it will transition by itself, and not be janky
transition: property name | duration | timing function | delay
there are many many timing functions, go have fun*************
single out transitions, prevents something down the line

"transform" function, also have fun with this function, allows for animations

background-size: cover
background-position: where you start using the image
background tag: needs to be more precise if you want to squeeze in everything in this

Google fonts also free
take fonts from google, so that every system accessing will be able to see the font
