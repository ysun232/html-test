        over 15,000 years ago,[6] before the
        development of agriculture.[1] Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human
        behavior,[9] leading to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich
        diet
        that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]

        The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,
        sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape,
        size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads,
        protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy,
        and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them
        the sobriquet of "man's best friend."

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>

    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event occurred 65 million years ago and brought an end to the dinosaurs and
        the
        appearance of the first carnivorans.[19] The name carnivoran is given to a member of the order Carnivora.
        Carnivorans possess a common arrangement of teeth called carnassials, in which the first lower molar and the
        last
        upper premolar possess blade-like enamel crowns that act similar to a pair of shears for cutting meat. This
        dental
        arrangement has been modified by adaptation over the past 60 million years for diets composed of meat, for
        crushing
        vegetation, or for the loss of the carnassial function altogether as in seals, sea lions, and walruses. Today,
        not
        all carnivorans are carnivores, such as the insect-eating Aardwolf.[4]</p>

    <h3>Domestication</h3>
    <p>The generally accepted earliest dog remains were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic,
        genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.[21] The dog was dated to 14,223
        years
        ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder
        and
        buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine distemper.[22] Earlier remains dating back
        to
        30,000 years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated[23]
        because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene.[1]</p>
    <p>This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated[8][7] in the time of
        hunter–gatherers,[6]
        which predates agriculture.[1] DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and
        descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was distinct from the modern wolf lineage.[5][6] Most
        dogs
        form a sister group to the remains of a Late Pleistocene wolf found in the Kessleroch cave near Thayngen in the
        canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, which dates to 14,500 years ago. The most recent common ancestor of both is
        estimated to be from 32,100 years ago.[24] This indicates that an extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been
        the
        ancestor of the dog,[7][1][25] with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.[7]</p>
    <p>The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into
        domestication.[23][26] The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and
        archaeologists for decades.[8] Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago,
        in
        one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia.[10] In 2021, a literature
        review
        of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North
        Siberians,
        then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia.[21]</p>

        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Black_Labrador_Retriever_-_Male_IMG_3323.jpg/1920px-Black_Labrador_Retriever_-_Male_IMG_3323.jpg"
             alt="The goodest Black Labrador Retriever">
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <h4>Skeleton</h4>
        <p>All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical skeletal structure with the exception
            of
            the
            number of bones in the tail, although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different
            types.[27][28] The dog’s skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back have
            extensions
            for powerful back muscles to connect to, the long ribs provide plenty of room for the heart and lungs, and
            the
            shoulders are unattached to the skeleton allowing great flexibility.[27][28]
        </p>
        <h4>Senses</h4>
        <p>A dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and sensitivity to Earth's magnetic field.
            Another
            study
            has suggested that dogs can see Earth's magnetic field.[30]</p>
        <h4>Coat</h4>
        <p>The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves)
            originating
            from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single," with the topcoat
            only.
            Breeds may have an occasional "blaze," stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.[31]
            Premature
            graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors,
            anxiety
            behaviors, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.[32]</p>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness,
            deafness,
            pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs
            are
            pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all breeds and ages, and Gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which
            affects
            larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also
            susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms,
            which is
            a
            roundworm species that lives in the hearts of dogs.</p>
