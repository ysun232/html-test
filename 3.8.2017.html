    <h1>The first element of today's new session would be about RGB and Hex color usage</h1>
    
    <h2 style="background-color:rgb(255,0,0)"> See? I used the rgb function as to obtain a red background</h2>
    <h2 style="background-color:#FF0000;">I can also obtain red by using the hex code, however I will need more practice as to know which code I should be using for which color</h2>
    <h2 style="background-color:#FFFF00">This is another color that I made using the hex function</h2>
    
    <p>However, I will be using the CSS introduction for HTML, and add changes to the document from the header of this document</p>
    
    <p>If I want to link to any external style sheet, I can just use the link function, and using href to get the external style sheet. I will dab into CSS later on</p>
    
    <p>Here is an active link that will redirect you to google: <a href="https://google.ca/"> GOOOOOGLLLLEEEEE</a>, you can also change the color of unvisited, visited, and over and active </p>
    
    <p>If you click on this google link, it will open in a different tab instead
    <a href="https://google.ca/" TARGET="_blank"> GOOOOOGLLLLEEEEE</a>, which in my opinion is one of the most useful functions. The default is set to _self.

    <a href="watermelon.jpg" id="tips"><img src="watermelon.jpg"> A watermelon picture that will take you to a watermelon picture</a>
    
    
    <h1>Listening to Faded all day long</h1>
    
    <!--The bookmark function looks very very  -->
    <a href="#tips">revisit the watermelon section</a>
    
    
    <p>I changed the size, both width and heigh of the watermelon image for fun</p>
    <img src="watermelon.jpg" alt="watermelon picture" style="width:120px;height:120px;">
     
    
    <h1>Dont forget to always give the images and alt attribute, the websites all use it and will not allow it to work correctly if there is none</h1>
    
    <h2>For any image, you can also directly link the website instead of having the image in your folder</h2>
