    <h1>This is the first Sentence of today's lesson</h1>
    
    <!-- I made the background color light grey, and some of the text strong, with a change of color of the text to blue, I am giving myself so much trouble by adding these comments for everything that I wrote-->
    <p style="background-color:lightgrey;"><strong>Anything here will be in strong character</strong><strong style="color:blue;"> <br>I can also change the color while keeping the strong attribute.</strong></p>
    
    <!--For this paragraph, I used the <pre> function, as not to worry about the format of the sentences, however I do worry about how it will look like I will add stuff like CSS and modifiers like javascript or BOOTSTRAP. Back to the subject, I did use the <i> and <em> functions, however, I have also discovered that these two functions cannot be used one inside the other -->
    <p>
    <pre>Now, skipping to the next
    paragraph</pre>
    <i>This part of the paragraph is going to be in italic, and <em>this part is going to be both italicized and emphasized, <br \> however it looks like I cannot emphasize and italic text at the same time</em></i>
    </p>
    
    <!--The <small> function just adds some change in the size of the text, however it does not add anymore utility, it probably is the lazy way of changing the size of the text without relying on CSS -->
    <h2>Let us now test the function <small> of small</small>, there is only a slight change in size of the text, if I do not pay attention to it, I do not see it</h2>
    
    <!--The <del> function does look very promising, as it allows you to erase part of your code, but show that you first wrote it but deleted it afterwards because of w.e reason -->
    <h3>however, for personal notes, I can use the <del>deleted function</del>, as to "delete" an unwanted element, but leave some traces of it</h3>
    
    <h4>I can also use the <ins>inserted</ins> function, if I wanna emphasize on the changes that I have made, I think I can also change the color of the inserted text, <ins style="color:red;">see this?.</ins></h4>
    
    <h3 style="color:darkblue; background-color:lightblue;">This one is going to be for the <sub> subscripted text, <sup>and I will try to add the superscripted text in the same function as subscripted<sub>Having<sup>some<sup>fun<sub>in<sup>this<sub>lesson</sub></sup></sub></sup></sup></sub></sup></sub> looks like it works, <sup>however, it looks different that the superscripted text that I can get outside of the subscripted text, as the on outside of the subscripted</sup> looks smaller in comparison. With each addition of sub or sup in the text, the text becomes smaller and smaller.</h3> 
    
    <h4>I will also try the <mark>marked functio0n</mark>, I did not add any style modifiers for the marked section.</h4>
    
    <h5>As for this part, I will be adding a nice little quote by myself <br><q>I am Yilong Sun, you are now reading my progress towards mastery of html!!!</q><br> But there is also the blockquote function that can be used for longer amounts of text <br><blockquote>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@, as some people once said.</blockquote><br> The blockquote looks like it also indents the text, (making my life easier in the future).</h5>
    
    <p>I can also make abbreviations for any word that I do not want to retype multiple times just like <abbr title="Road to HTML Mastery">RTHM</abbr>, which is the abbreviation of Road to HTML <mark>Mastery</mark>.</p>
    
    <h1>As you can probably see, the page is still looking very basic, and it is also very hard to find anything I want, except with the Control + F function of any web browser. Yilong, you need to improve and make this very nice looking compared to any other website.</h1>
    
    <p>This address function looks not nearly as useful as it sounds, but some people use it because it looks good, but remember to break lines yourself when you want to add any address, it also does not look anything different than a normal paragraph, therefore I absolutely have no idea why I would use it unless its for referencing purposes, it does look slightly different than the normal paragraph.<br>

    <h3 style="color:green;background-color:pink">As for this part, I will cite where it comes from <cite>I am learning everything about HTML from w3schools.com, and I hope that I will soon move on to CSS and JAVASCRIPT</cite> as to improve and make better looking websites and hope to open sessions.</h3>
    
    <h2>bdo element? Reminds me of black desert online, an online game that I think spent too much time on, on a more serious note, it modifies how the text reads, (from left to right or right to left)<bdo dir="ltr"> <bdo dir="rtl">See? This text will be written from the right to the left.</bdo></bdo> Use a mirror and you will understand what I wrote, also you cannot use bdo function inside one another.</h2>
    
    <p>I, myself, the person that wrote the website, has a headache looking at the website, so don't even bother looking at it and make sense out of it, I might be a little bit crazy, but it does get boring if I'm not a little bit crazy.</p>
    
    <h2>Back to serious business, let us see what the keyboard input function does <kbd> What does this function do?</kbd>, it makes anything inside the kbd another font, as if someone else typed in there. <br>
    <samp>Same principle as kbd, the sample function's only usefulness is to make the text look different.</samp>
    <p>Could the "code function" be any different from the kbd or samp function? <code> 1+1=3</code>, sadly it does the same thing as samp and kbd</p>
    </h2>
    
    
    <p>However, I do have to go through all these functions, and the variable function does not look promising either <var>see? it looks the same as fcode and kbd and samp</var>, actually it makes it italicized-ish?</p>
    
    
    
    <!-- I can finally start writing comments instead of using paragraphs to write everything, however I do want to read it myself whenever I will need it, therefore I will keep using the paragraph function -->
    
    <!-- However I do understand that it is very important to write comments as to make the next person and myself have an easier time finding anything that makes sense -->
    
    <h1 style="background-color:purple;color:white;">I think this will be it for today, I do not think I have the patience nor the interest to learn more today, one step at a time is the way to go with this kind of learning, I hope that whoever read this had a fun time and somewhat learned a bit about html! (even though what I wrote is extremely messy!!!!)</h1>
