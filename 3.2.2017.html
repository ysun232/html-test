<body style="background-color:lightgrey;">
    <head>
        <title>Bread</title>
    </head>
    
    <p>I have changed the background color to lightgrey, I added the color change command in the body section</p>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>My name is Yilong</p>
    <a href="https://github.com" >This is github link</a>
    <img src="watermelon.jpg">
    
    <p title="Yilong Sun">This is a title... just kidding</p>
    <h1 style="color:white; font-family:verdana">This is heading 1, I will also change the font and color of the header</h1>
    <h2 style="background-color:blue; color:white;">This is heading 2, I will also try to change the background+font color of only this section, even though the body is already light grey</h2>
    <h2><pre>
    This is a  preformatted poem inside a heading 2 just for testing purposes. 
    
    
    That will follow any of the space that I have put in the original 
    code, even if there are no
    break command. 
    
    <p>I will be testing the insert cursor function of brackets
    
    <pre>
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaa
    bbb
    
    sss
    
    de
    
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaa
    bbb
    
    sss
    
    de
    </pre></p>
    
    
    
    I skipped a lot of lines just above this sentence
    </pre></h2>
    
    <h3>This is heading 3<pre>I have put this paragraph inside the same clause as the heading 3, just for testing purposes</pre></h3>
    <h4 style="text-align:right; color:white;">This is heading 4, that is aligned to the right and is white</h4>
    <h4>Following this line there will be a thematic break in the HTML page</h4>
    <hr \>
    <h5 style="text-align:center;">This is heading 5, that is centered</h5>
    <h5>There will be a line break after this sentence</h5>
    <br>
    <h6 style="font-size:200%;">This is heading 6, I changed this title with the percentage funtion of font size, therefore even if the header is 6, it is very very big</h6>
    <h6>There is no heading 7 because heading 7 would be too small to read(I do not know if it is really because of that)</h6>
    
    <h6 style="font-size: 26px">If you ever find a really interesting website, you can always view the source code by right clicking the page and select "View Page Source", it can be viewed in your browser. Just in case you ever find any website very interesting* I changed the font size of h6, so instead of having very little characters, I now have 26px characters</h6>
    

    <h1 style="color:red;">I will now go back to using header 1, but change the color of the text</h1>
    <p style="color:blue; font-size:30px">Now I will use paragraph, and change the size and color, although i can use inline to change it in the source code, I will use CSS later on as an easier way to manage the colors and layout of my internet page.</p>
    
    
    <p><b>I will now try to use the bold funtion for this</b> part of the website.<br>
    <strong>testing strong text, that is supposed to be used for important messages and see if there is actually a difference between bold and strong, I do not think I see anything different appearance wise</strong>
